# RLinOperations

Materials for the first two days code demonstration at the [RL in Operations Workshop](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news-events/conference/bootcamp-reinforcement-learning.aspx) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

The subfolders should contain the appropriate code demos for the different demonstrations.  Note that each of them have their own readme files with installation instructions to install the prerequisite python packages.
