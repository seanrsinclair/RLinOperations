    "One potential application of reinforcement learning involves positioning a server or servers (in this case an ambulance) in an optimal way geographically to respond to incoming calls while minimizing the distance traveled by the servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is closely related to the [k-server problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-server_problem), where there are $k$ servers stationed in a space that must respond to requests arriving in that space in such a way as to minimize the total distance traveled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ambulance routing problem addresses the problem by modeling an environment where there are ambulances stationed at locations, and calls come in that one of the ambulances must be sent to respond to. The goal of the agent is to minimize both the distance traveled by the ambulances between calls and the distance traveled to respond to a call by optimally choosing the locations to station the ambulances. The ambulance environment has been implemented in two different ways; as a 1-dimensional number line $[0,1]$ along which ambulances will be stationed and calls will arrive, and a graph with nodes where ambulances can be stationed and calls can arrive, and edges between the nodes that ambulances travel along.\n"

Each ambulance in the problem can be located anywhere in $X$, so the state space is $S = X^k$, where $k$ is the number of ambulances. The distance function is chosen by the user, who specifies what kind of norm to use. Calls for an ambulance can also arrive anywhere in $X$, and the nearest ambulance will respond to the call, leaving the locations of the other ambulances unchanged.
